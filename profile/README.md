EVEE is an interactive model simulating a modern electric grid, controlled by a tablet displaying a user interface ([UI source code here](https://github.com/dafnamargalit/mission-zero-pwa)). The exhibit contains an autonomous electric vehicle that drives throughout a model city with key locations such as a solar farm, a parking garage in the city with charging stations, and a house, either chosen by the user or by the "automatic driving mode". At each location, the flow of energy is portrayed through LED motion. This is intended to help the user visualize where power is going toward, and what direction itâ€™s moving in.
